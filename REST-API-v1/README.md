GOAL: To go through the creation of a simple server completely on my own. Expecting to find out more of what I need to practice with by way of seeingmy struggles through this small project.<br>

This project is going to contain a simple server setup that will allow for the user to make requests with all the main CRUD methods. The topic of the server will be a Dog Owner social media, the database will contain a collection of users, each user will have their own object which will include data like the owners name, pets name, pets breed, favorite (pet food, toy, place to sleep). Will be able to GET all users, create via PUT a new user, edit via PATCH a user, DELETE a user.<br>
The database will be a .txt file included in the [database folder](link).
